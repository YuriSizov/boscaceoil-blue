_[bús-ka kyó-al] — a music box._

**Bosca Ceoil: The Blue Album** (or _Bosca Ceoil Blue_, for short) is a simple and beginner-friendly app for making music. Using a step sequencer you can create anything from a simple beat to a complex melodic piece — with huge selection of synthesized instruments!

_Bosca Ceoil Blue_ is a modern port of **Terry Cavanagh's [Bosca Ceoil](https://github.com/TerryCavanagh/boscaceoil)**, and attempts to preserve everything that made the original so approachable and intuitive. And just like the original, _Bosca Ceoil Blue_ is absolutely free and provided under a permissive open source license, should you need to modify it.

## FAQ

### Is _Bosca Ceoil Blue_ compatible with the original?

Yes, the new version is fully compatible with the original _Bosca Ceoil_ and should be perceived as the next major release in the series. In fact, the first release of _The Blue Album_ is versioned `3.0` to indicate just that. This version should sound the same, loads all existing `.ceol` files, and has every feature of the original.

This also means that tracks created with _The Blue Album_ `3.x` can be loaded back into the original _Bosca Ceoil_, if you so desire. Future releases of _Bosca Ceoil Blue_ are likely to introduce changes and features incompatible with the original, whenever that might be necessary. However, you will always be able to open and edit existing `.ceol` files in every future version of the tool, with your songs being automatically converted to the newest format.

### Why does _Bosca Ceoil_ need a port?

Original _Bosca Ceoil_ is a great tool for budding musicians and game developers. It's almost perfect, but can still benefit from some UX enhancements and improvements to its composing features. It's also using an outdated technology stack which makes it hard to impossible to run it on modern systems, namely macOS and web.

The goal of the _Bosca Ceoil Blue_ project is to make _Bosca Ceoil_ more accessible to today's users and also to new contributors. We achieve this by reimplementing the entire application with a more modern set of tools, as a [Godot engine](https://godotengine.org/) project.

A general-purpose game engine like Godot gives the project means to run on Linux, macOS, and Windows, as well as on web and even mobile phones — almost hassle-free. It's also a popular tool among many game developers, which should make _Bosca Ceoil Blue_ an inviting project for new collaborators.
